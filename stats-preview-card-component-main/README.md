## My process

I identified the components necessary for the solution first:
- A card vertically and horizontally centred.
- 50% of the card would be the information, 50% the picture.
- The information card contains a title, a paragraph, and some statistics.

I then created the HTML elements for these particular items, and began to think about the styling.
I felt that this was a good case to use flex boxes, as this would give me a great deal of control over the
flow and spacing of each element. After the initial changes of font and colors to the style guide, I began placing everything
into a flex box appropriately, changing the order and flipping the card to be a column on mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good exercise in coding to a design brief given to me, which is not a luxury I'm afforded in my current day job!
I learned more about flexboxes, and how I can change the way they work depending on the given screen size.

### Continued development

I'd like to work on using semantic HTML markup to make my work more accessible, and custom CSS properties to make my CSS
cleaner and more reusable.
